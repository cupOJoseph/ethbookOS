# ethbookOS
A project built for ETHDenver 2019. A fork of chromiumOS with built-in Ethereum functionality

Goals:
- Create a distribution of ethbookOS with native plug-ins to run dApps and IPFS and ZKP
- ethbooks that run ethbookOS are light-weight both in terms of hardware and software, and secure
- ethbooks will take blockchain technology from BUIDLers to consummers 
- ethbooks will take power from the powerful few back to the people

Why are we buidling ethbook

  - "When we are dead, it’s not what we HODL or SODL that matters. It’s what we BUIDL" - Ajit Tripathi, Consensys Enterprise
